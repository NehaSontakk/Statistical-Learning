# Statistical-Learning
Introduction to Statistical Learning and Elements of Statistical Learning covered, along with the Stanford course on the same; taught by Rob Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie. I highly recommend this course to understand the statistical concepts behind machine learning algorithms. There are continuous quizzes and coding assignments that helped me brush up on my R skills as well.

### Regression

Chapter 3 of statistical learning covers various regression principles.
1.  Metrics : t-statistic, p-values, confidence intervals.
2.  Linear Regression
3.  Multivariate Regression
4.  Non linearities and Interactions
5.  Qualitative data management

### Classification

Chapter 4 covering many concepts under classification.
1.  Z-statistic
2.  Logistic Regression
3.  Linear Discriminant Analysis
4.  K-Nearest Neighbor Classification

### Re-Sampling
1.  Resampling Notes.pdf : Notes on resampling strategies
2.  Cross Validation
3.  Bootstrap

### Model Selection Strategies
1.  Subset Selection
2.  Best Subset Selection
2.  Validation Set
3.  Forward/Backward Subset Selection
4.  Ridge and Lasso Selection

### Polynomials, Splines and GAMs
Chapter 7 on nonlinear functions
1.  Polynomials: Fitting polynomials functions and standard error bands.
2.  Splines

### Tree Learning Methods
Chapter 8 on learning using trees
1.  Decision Trees
2.  Bagging
3.  Out of bag sampling
4.  Random Forests
5.  Boosting
